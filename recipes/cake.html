        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>
                <h4>Make the Batter</h4>
                <p>Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Bake the Cake</h4>
                <p>Pour the batter into two prepared cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Frost the Cake</h4>
                <p>While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.</p>
                <p>When the cake is completely cooled, top each layer with the frosting. Stack them and continue frosting until the cake is completely covered.</p>
